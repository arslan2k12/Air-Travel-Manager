# Air-Travel-Manager
Course Project: Data Structures and Algorithms, 2013

Our project is based on dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest route between two cities of the world, based on fare or duration.
We have used STL vectors to store cities, adjacent city of each city and flights between cities.


Our cities are nodes, and flights are edges of Graph.
Source and Destination are input by user, and Departure, Arrival, Duration Time along with weather conditions, Contact number of airport and the route of flight is also displayed.


Running Time of our Dijkstra algorithm is O(V^2) where V is the number of cities.Further using Fibonaci Heap, we can reduce it to O(E+VlogV).


Our project is of level 3, because we have used Graphs as well as STL Vectors (not studied in class) in our project.
